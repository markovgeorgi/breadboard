# 🔄 Déjà Code

A system that detects when you're writing code that already exists as a shared
utility. Instead of relying on memory or discipline, ESLint rules surface
existing helpers in real-time through IDE errors.

## Philosophy

- **Complexity threshold.** Only flag multi-statement patterns where extraction
  genuinely reduces complexity. One-liners are never flagged — that's noise, not
  help.
- **Error, not warning.** If we lint it, we error. Warnings train people to
  ignore lint output.
- **Point, don't block.** The error message always names the existing utility
  and its file path. The fix is obvious.

## How it works

1. **Detect** — ESLint rules in `eslint-rules/deja-code-*.js` match structural
   AST patterns that correspond to known utilities.
2. **Surface** — The IDE shows an error with a message like: _"Déjà Code: this
   pattern is already implemented as `groupBy()` — see
   packages/utils/src/collections.ts"_
3. **Grow** — When the agent (or a human) extracts a new utility from a desire
   path, a corresponding ESLint rule is written. The catalog grows organically.
